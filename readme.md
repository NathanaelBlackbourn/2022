Sublime Systems is the the website I use to display my school work and experiment with my own projects.


Process

My design for the site contains a dynamic layout within the header. It will contain navigation for the site and my CV. It expands to full screen  height to display the CV and slides off-screen to display projects and work. The structure within the header is based on that of bootstrap.
